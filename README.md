A simple video cube example to build off of.

Primarily influenced by the Perfume Global Project #002 site!

Based on Jeff Crouse's Youtube example from his Code for Art class, which also means it uses his ofxJSON addon ;)

Also based on the openFrameworks ofBoxExample.

Full instructions to come but you should be able to just clone the repo and build.

What I want to do next:

Make a simple UI for testing

Add a FBO shader on top for simple blurring when cubes move

Add a simple bloom shader as well

Add a static tv shader as the background

Slow down cube movement

Make cube movement into full particle system

Think about some kind of audio componenet 

Clean up code with comments for going back and forth between playlists or searching on youtube, which might be fun to do in the UI

Look at Yin's code from Patrick's class and think about how the cubes can be generated and move

Make ifdef for searching versus playlist

Make command line interface!

Create createPlaylistSearchString function

Make boxes to be able to "disassemble" into smaller boxes, with video texture on them as well (the ultimate goal!)
